         IO Monad - delay execution for side affect function
         IO is side effect
         so use IO Monad
         Use for side effect function 
         there is no side effect before side effect function, so can compose with param
         there is side effect after run side effect function. 

         thunk - same with callback (include side effect), will run some time
         run() - delay function, delay excecution
         map() - return new IO(() => fn(this.run()))
         bind() - flatmap - return new IO(() => fn(this.run()).run()) => unbox
         above methods will not run before calling run() method
         ioLog - consold.log()
         lift - normal value to monad value

         Promise - network call (side affect) , use it when call ajax
